Octave/Matlab scripts for the Machine Learning Exposed workshop

# linearRegGuess.m

This contains a script to show a basic linear regression problem, and illustrates the differences between the hypothesis being proposed
(what we think y is, guessing how x is transformed to get the y values), and the actual y values from example data.
This script uses showDifferencesForGuess.m, so both will need to be loaded for it to work.
