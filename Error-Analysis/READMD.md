#% Error Analysis

In these examples we look at some of the analysis we can do on our models.
We want to know how well out models a) fit the data,
b) generalise to new examples.

## Test Error
The first file is [testError.m](https://github.com/katharinebeaumont/machine-learning-exposed/blob/master/Error-Analysis/testError.m).
This works out the test error for a classification problem: the fraction of the examples in the test set that the hypothesis has mislabelled.
